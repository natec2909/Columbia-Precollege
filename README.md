# Columbia-Intro-to-Python
Our team consisting of Shane Dillon, Rindo Yoshioka, Brandon Chao and myself worked to combine a 2D multifighter fighter game with a comprehensive data dashboard that aims to guide and justify game development decisions using real world KPIs and market insights. The dashboard, built with Python using Tkinter, Pandas, and matplotlib, visualizes global revenue, player retention rates, average session time, top regions by sales, and even esports prize pool trends. These insights informed our design choices, charcter balence, and monitization strategies. AI tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot supported our workflow with debugging, logic clarification, and minor fixes, though human testing and team collaboration remained essential for proper functioning and execution of the code. Our team would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our professor Mr. Canglosi for guiding us through the SDLC and to our TA Mya Nikitas for her unwavering support with technical issues and keeping us protected and on track throughout the development process.
